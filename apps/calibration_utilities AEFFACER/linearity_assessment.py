"""
    The idea of the linearity assessment script, is to assess the behaviour of
    a sensor regarding increasing light flux.
    Without accounting for quantum effects, we assume that if the integration
    time is twice as high then integrated light flux should be twice as high
    and then digital signal value should also be twice as high.

    Of course, in order to mitigates the influence of noise, we need to perform
    some statistics on the data.
